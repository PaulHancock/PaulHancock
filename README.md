### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an astronomer turned data scientist working at the Curtin Institute for Computation. As an astronomer I collect voltages from TV antennas in the Australian desert and turn them into images of the universe using the supercomputers at Pawsey. Sounds like magic but thats how low frequency radio astronomy works!

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on making the world a better place. Small steps are important. In my professional life this means creating software for astronomy which will make better use of current instruments, and make it possible to work with the telescopes of the future on the computers of the future.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning more about containers every day. Right now I'm enjoying the portability that they give to my projects.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on anything that can make use of source finding algorithims in radio astronomy. Do you have a large volume of survey images that you need to turn into catalogues? I can help!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, Radio Astronomy, High Performance Computing, or Data Mining.
- :mortar_board: I teach Data Mining and Introduction to Programming in Python
