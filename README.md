### Hi there 👋

I use supercomputers to turn voltages collected by TV antennas in the desert into images of the universe. Sounds like magic but thats how low frequency radio astronomy works!

- 🔭 I'm currently working on making the world a better place. Small steps are important. In my professional life this means I'm creating software for radio astronomy which will allow us to make better use of our current instruments, and make it possible to work with the telescopes of the future on the computers of the future.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about containers every day. Right now I'm enjoying the portability that they give to my projects.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on anything that can make use of source finding algorithims in radio astronomy. Do you have a large volume of survey images that you need to turn into catalogues? I can help!
- 👯 I'm also looking to collaborate with anyone that is interested in space situational awareness.
- 💬 Ask me about Python, Radio Astronomy, HPC, Space Situational Awareness.
